 use miette error handling pattern and provide rich diagnotics

use strongly typed idiomatic rust. Think to express the function in datatypes
do error handling
try to express options on how to handle issues for calling functions

## Library Usage Patterns

### Error handling (miette + thiserror)
- All error enums derive `#[derive(Debug, Error, Diagnostic)]`
- Each variant has `#[diagnostic(code(...), help(...))]`
- Subsystem errors chain via `#[error(transparent)] #[diagnostic(transparent)]`
- Return `AkhResult<T>` (alias for `Result<T, AkhError>`) from public APIs
- Subsystem functions return their own result type (e.g., `VsaResult<T>`, `StoreResult<T>`)

### HNSW (hnsw_rs + anndists)
- Import distances from `anndists::dist::DistHamming` (NOT `hnsw_rs::dist`)
- Hnsw requires lifetime: `Hnsw<'static, u32, DistHamming>`
- `insert()` takes `(&[T], usize)` tuple and uses `&self` (not `&mut self`)
- `search()` takes `(&[T], k, ef_search)` and returns `Vec<Neighbour>`

### Oxigraph (SPARQL store)
- `Store::new()` for in-memory, `Store::open(path)` for persistent
- Triples use `Quad::new(subject, predicate, object, GraphNameRef::DefaultGraph)`
- SymbolId maps to IRI: `https://akh-medu.dev/sym/{id}`
- Query with `store.query("SELECT ...")` → `QueryResults::Solutions`

### Petgraph (knowledge graph)
- Must `use petgraph::visit::EdgeRef` to access `.source()` and `.target()` on edges
- Use `DiGraph<SymbolId, EdgeData>` with separate `DashMap<SymbolId, NodeIndex>` index

### Egg (e-graph reasoning)
- Define language with `define_language!` macro
- Create rules with `rewrite!` macro
- Run with `Runner::default().with_expr(&expr).run(&rules)`
- Extract best with `Extractor::new(&runner.egraph, AstSize)`

### Redb (durable store)
- Define tables as const: `const TABLE: TableDefinition<&[u8], &[u8]> = TableDefinition::new("name")`
- Use `begin_write()` / `begin_read()` for transactions
- Drop table handles before calling `txn.commit()`
- When checking if remove() found something, extract the bool inside the scope

### Edition 2024
- `unsafe fn` bodies are NOT implicitly unsafe — wrap each unsafe op in `unsafe {}`
- Use `edition = "2024"` in Cargo.toml

### Agent module patterns
- Agent concepts (goals, memories, episodes) are **regular Entity symbols** with well-known relation predicates (prefixed `agent:`) — no new `SymbolKind` variants
- `AgentPredicates` holds 12 well-known relation SymbolIds resolved at agent init
- `AgentError::Engine` wraps `Box<AkhError>` to break the recursive type cycle; manual `From<AkhError>` impl handles boxing
- Memory consolidation stores `DerivationKind::AgentConsolidation` provenance; decisions store `DerivationKind::AgentDecision`
- Tools are compile-time trait impls (`impl Tool for X`) with runtime registration in `ToolRegistry`
- The OODA loop is synchronous — no async runtime

## Agent Roadmap

Phases 1–7 are complete (engine + agent scaffold). The agent has working infrastructure
(memory, goals, tools, consolidation, provenance) but the decision-making core is a
placeholder. The phases below evolve it into a real autonomous agent.

### Phase 8a — Fix wiring bugs (prerequisites for real autonomy) ✓
- [x] Wire up `reference_count` in Decide phase (increment when WM entries are consulted)
- [x] Fix status triple accumulation: restore_goals now picks highest SymbolId (most recent) deterministically
- [x] Connect recalled episodes from Observe to Orient/Decide (full EpisodicEntry data flows through)
- [x] Enable all 5 tools in `select_tool()` — anti-repetition, memory_recall, kg_mutate, synthesize_triple
- [x] Fix Act phase: evaluate_goal_progress() checks criteria keywords against non-metadata tool output
- [x] Fix self-referential criteria match: agent-metadata labels (desc:, status:, criteria:, goal:) filtered out

### Phase 8b — Success criteria & goal autonomy ✓
- [x] Parse and evaluate success criteria against KG state (pattern matching on triples)
- [x] Let Act produce Completed/Failed based on criteria evaluation (two-signal: tool output + KG state)
- [x] Stall detection: track `cycles_worked` and `last_progress_cycle` per goal, `is_stalled()` method
- [x] Integrate goal decomposition into OODA loop (`decompose_stalled_goals()` auto-fires after each cycle)
- [x] Goal decomposition splits on commas/"and", suspends parent, creates active children
- [x] Add `suspend_goal()`, `fail_goal()`, `decompose_stalled_goal()` to Agent public API
- [x] Metadata label filtering: agent-metadata (desc:, status:, criteria:, goal:, episode:, summary:, tag:) excluded from criteria matching

### Phase 8c — Intelligent decision-making
- [ ] Replace if/else `select_tool()` with utility-based scoring
- [ ] Score each tool by expected value given: current goal, orientation context, WM history
- [ ] Add loop detection: track recent (tool, goal) pairs, penalize repetition
- [ ] Strategy rotation: when stuck, try tools the agent hasn't used for this goal
- [ ] Use recalled episodic memories to inform tool selection (past strategies for similar goals)

### Phase 8d — Session persistence & REPL
- [ ] Serialize/deserialize WorkingMemory to engine's durable store
- [ ] Add agent REPL mode (interactive loop with user input between cycles)
- [ ] Persist cycle_count and restore on agent restart
- [ ] CLI session continuity: `agent resume` picks up where it left off

### Phase 8e — External tools & world interaction
- [ ] File I/O tool: read/write files the agent can use as scratch or data sources
- [ ] HTTP tool: fetch URLs, call APIs
- [ ] Shell exec tool: run commands with sandboxing
- [ ] User interaction tool: ask the user a question and incorporate the answer

### Phase 8f — Planning & reflection
- [ ] Multi-step planning: decompose goals into ordered tool-call sequences before executing
- [ ] Reflection: after N cycles, agent reviews its own WM and strategy effectiveness
- [ ] Meta-reasoning: agent can modify its own goal priorities and create new goals
- [ ] Backtracking: if a plan fails, revert to last good state and try alternative
