# Akh-medu Architecture

> Last updated: 2026-02-22 (Phase 15a complete — causal world model)

## Overview

Akh-medu is a neuro-symbolic AI engine that runs entirely on CPU with no LLM dependency. It hybridizes:

- **Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA)** — 10,000-bit binary hypervectors for distributed representation
- **Knowledge Graphs** — dual-indexed (petgraph + oxigraph/SPARQL) for structured symbolic reasoning
- **E-graph Reasoning** — equality saturation via `egg` for symbolic rewriting
- **Autonomous Agent** — OODA-loop agent with 23+ tools, working/episodic memory, planning, reflection
- **Code Generation** — KG-to-Rust pipeline: code_gen tool, RustCodeGrammar, compiler feedback loop, parameterized templates, VSA code pattern encoding, pattern mining from examples, library learning cycle
- **Multilingual Grammar** — GF-inspired abstract/concrete syntax split for 5 languages
- **Content Library** — document ingestion (PDF, EPUB, HTML) with chunking and semantic enrichment
- **Tiered Storage** — hot (DashMap) → warm (mmap) → cold (redb) for scalability

## Core Data Model

### Symbols
- **SymbolId**: `NonZeroU64` (niche-optimized for `Option` packing)
- **SymbolKind**: `Entity`, `Relation`, `Composite`, `Glyph(codepoint)`
- **AtomicSymbolAllocator**: thread-safe monotonic ID generator

### Triples
- `(subject: SymbolId, predicate: SymbolId, object: SymbolId)` with confidence, timestamp, provenance_id, compartment_id
- Stored in both petgraph (in-memory graph ops) and oxigraph (SPARQL queries)
- Each triple carries provenance linking back to how it was derived

### Hypervectors (VSA)
- 10,000-bit binary vectors, SIMD-accelerated (AVX2 with generic fallback)
- Operations: bind (XOR), unbind, bundle (majority vote), permute, similarity (Hamming)
- Item Memory: HNSW approximate nearest-neighbor search

## Reasoning Systems

| System | Strategy | Use Case |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Spreading Activation | Seeds → expand frontier via graph edges + VSA recovery | Forward inference, "what follows from X?" |
| Backward Chaining | Goal ← find supporting evidence recursively | Why-questions, evidence chains |
| Superposition | Parallel competing hypotheses, constructive/destructive interference | Multi-path exploration |
| E-graph Rewriting | `AkhLang` + `egg` equality saturation | Symbolic simplification, equivalence |
| Confidence Fusion | Noisy-OR and consensus across multi-source evidence | Combining evidence |

### Phase 9 — Production Pipeline (Wired into Engine Lifecycle)

All Phase 9 systems are wired into the engine's `add_triple()` and `remove_triple()` paths, controlled by `Phase9Config` flags (all enabled by default):

**`add_triple()` pipeline** (pre/post hooks):
1. **Constraint check** — `ConstraintRegistry::check_triple()` rejects arity/type violations
2. **Contradiction detection** — `check_contradictions()` with configurable policy (Warn/Reject/Replace)
3. Core KG + SPARQL insertion
4. **Hierarchy invalidation** — `rel:generalizes`/`rel:inverse` triples mark hierarchy dirty for lazy rebuild
5. **Skolem auto-grounding** — `SkolemRegistry::auto_ground()` checks newly satisfiable existentials

**`remove_triple()` with TMS cascade**:
1. Core KG + SPARQL removal
2. **TMS retraction** — `TruthMaintenanceSystem::retract()` cascades to derived symbols
3. Cascaded triples removed from KG + SPARQL

**Inference integration** — `Engine::infer()` builds `InferPhase9Context`:
- Hierarchy-aware spreading activation (specialization + inverse predicates)
- Temporal decay of triple confidences based on `TemporalRegistry` profiles

**Persistence** — 7 registries serialized via bincode to `TieredStore::put_meta()`:
TMS, TemporalRegistry, ConstraintRegistry, FunctionalPredicates, DisjointnessConstraints, SkolemRegistry, NartRegistry. PredicateHierarchy rebuilt from KG on startup.

## Agent Architecture

OODA loop (synchronous, no async runtime):
1. **Observe** — scan KG for active goals, recall episodic memories
2. **Orient** — assess working memory, build context
3. **Decide** — utility-based tool scoring with recency penalty, novelty bonus, episodic hints
4. **Act** — execute selected tool, evaluate goal progress

Supporting infrastructure: working memory (ephemeral), episodic memory (consolidated), goal management with HTN decomposition (6+ built-in + learned methods, dependency DAGs, VSA-based method selection), multi-step planning with backtracking, periodic reflection, Jungian psyche model, autonomous goal generation (CLARION-inspired drives: curiosity, coherence, completeness, efficiency), metacognitive self-evaluation (Nelson-Narens monitoring/control, ZPD, competence tracking, AGM belief revision, e-graph goal reformulation), resource awareness (VOC-based goal switching, CBR effort estimation, dynamic stall thresholds, diminishing returns detection, opportunity cost recording), procedural learning (Soar-inspired chunking: trace extraction → generalization → method compilation, success/failure tracking, dormancy pruning).

## Storage Architecture

```
Hot  (DashMap)     — sub-microsecond, volatile
Warm (mmap)        — memory-mapped files, persistent, fast reads
Cold (redb)        — ACID transactions, durable, slower writes
Provenance (redb)  — multi-index ledger (derived/source/kind)
SPARQL (oxigraph)  — persistent RDF store for structured queries
```

## Provenance

Every inference, agent decision, and knowledge derivation creates a `ProvenanceRecord`:
- Derived symbol, derivation kind (50 variants), confidence, depth, source symbols, metadata
- Full traceback from any result to its original sources
- Indices by derived symbol, source symbol, and kind for fast lookup

- [x] `AgentError::Pim` transparent variant
- [x] ~30 new unit tests

### Phase 13f — Calendar & Temporal Reasoning ✓
- [x] `CalendarError` miette diagnostic enum (5 variants: EventNotFound, Conflict, ParseError, SyncError, Engine) with `CalendarResult<T>`
- [x] `AllenRelation` enum: 13 variants (Before, After, Meets, MetBy, Overlaps, OverlappedBy, During, Contains, Starts, StartedBy, Finishes, FinishedBy, Equals) — pure `compute(s1,e1,s2,e2)`, `inverse()`, `is_overlapping()`, `as_label()`/`from_label()`, Display
- [x] `CalendarEvent` struct: symbol_id, summary, dtstart/dtend (u64), location, description, recurrence (reuses `pim::Recurrence`), ical_uid, confirmed — `duration_secs()`, `overlaps(other)`
- [x] `CalendarPredicates` — 13 Allen predicates (`time:before` .. `time:equals`) + 6 calendar metadata (`cal:dtstart`, `cal:dtend`, `cal:location`, `cal:summary`, `cal:conflicts-with`, `cal:requires-resource`) + `allen_predicate(relation)` mapper
- [x] `CalendarRoleVectors` — 4 deterministic VSA role vectors (day_of_week, time_of_day, activity_type, duration) via `encode_token(ops, "cal-role:*")`
- [x] `CalendarManager` — HashMap-based event store + optional predicates/role_vectors; add_event (create entity + KG sync + Allen relations + provenance), remove_event, get_event, events, events_in_range, today_events, week_events, detect_conflicts (sweep-line O(n log n)), compute_allen_relations, encode_temporal_pattern (VSA), sync_to_kg, persist/restore
- [x] `import_ical()` — RFC 5545 iCalendar parsing via `icalendar` crate, VEVENT extraction, chrono→u64 timestamp bridge, dedup by ical_uid (`#[cfg(feature = "calendar")]`)
- [x] `sync_caldav()` — HTTP GET via ureq with Basic auth, parse as iCal, dedup (`#[cfg(feature = "calendar")]`)
- [x] `DerivationKind::CalendarEventManaged` (tag 54) provenance variant
- [x] `calendar_rules()` — 2 e-graph rewrite rules: `before-trans` (transitivity of before), `cal-conflict` (overlapping + same resource → conflicts-with)
- [x] `Agent.calendar_manager` field with init/resume/persist lifecycle, `calendar_manager()` / `calendar_manager_mut()` accessors
- [x] `UserIntent::CalCommand` variant in NLP classifier, wired into TUI + headless chat
- [x] CLI: `Commands::Cal` with 6 subcommands (Today, Week, Conflicts, Add, Import, Sync)
- [x] `AgentError::Calendar` transparent variant
- [x] Feature: `calendar = ["icalendar", "chrono"]` — core module compiles without feature, only iCal import/CalDAV sync are feature-gated
- [x] 32 new unit tests (13 Allen relations + boundary cases, inverse symmetry, is_overlapping, label roundtrip, event duration/overlaps, manager CRUD, conflict detection, range queries, today/week, persist/restore, iCal import + dedup)

Phase 14a–14i: Purpose-driven bootstrapping with identity (9 sub-phases):
- **Identity**: 14a purpose + identity parser (NL → PurposeModel + IdentityRef, character reference extraction), 14b identity resolution (Wikidata + DBpedia + Wikipedia cascade → 12 Jungian archetypes → OCEAN → Psyche construction, Ritual of Awakening: self-naming via cultural morphemes)
- **Domain**: 14c domain expansion (Wikidata + Wikipedia + ConceptNet, VSA boundary detection), 14d prerequisite discovery + ZPD classification (Vygotsky zones, curriculum generation)
- **Acquisition**: 14e resource discovery (Semantic Scholar + OpenAlex + Open Library, quality scoring), 14f iterative ingestion (curriculum-ordered, NELL-style multi-extractor cross-validation, personality-biased resource selection)
- **Assessment**: 14g competence assessment (Dreyfus model, competency questions, graph completeness, VSA structural analysis)
- **Orchestration**: 14h bootstrap orchestrator (meta-OODA loop, personality shapes exploration style, Dreyfus-adaptive exploration), 14i community recipe sharing (TOML purpose recipes with identity section, ActivityPub federation, skillpack export)
